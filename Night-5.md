## Javascript Intro:

- JS Types:

  - String: Any value between double “” or single ‘’ quotes.
    - Example:
      ```js
      “I am a string.”
      ‘I am also a string.’
      ```
  - Number: Any numeric value without quotes surrounding it.
    - Example:
      ```js
      1, 23, 1000;
      ```
  - Boolean: True or false value without quotes surrounding it.
    - Example:
      ```js
      true, false;
      ```
  - Array: An ordered collection of values separated by commas.
    - Example:
      ```js
      [27, “My first Array”, true, {name: ‘Allen’}]  
      ```
      _Bracket notation to access values within Array_
  - Object: An unordered collection of key|value pairs.
    - Example:
      ```js
      { name: “Beast”, breed: “Boston Terrier”, age: 4, cool: true }
      ```
      _Dot notation to access values within Object_

- Variables:
  - Variables are used to store a reference to other values.
    - Example:
      ```js
      var myName = “Richard”
      ```
      _In the above example, we create a variable called “myName” and assign the value of a string to it. We can use this variable to reference our String of Richard. Variables can be assigned any JS type, not just strings._
